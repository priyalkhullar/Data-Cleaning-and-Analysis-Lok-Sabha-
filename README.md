# Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis-Lok-Sabha-

We analysed a huge collection of questions asked in the Indian Parliament from 1999 to 2019. This data was directly sourced from the Parliament's official website.
To ensure accuracy, we cleaned up the data. This involved fixing errors, removing unnecessary symbols, and dealing with missing information.
With the data cleaned, we analysed it to uncover interesting patterns and trends. We looked at how the number of questions changed over time, the most common topics discussed, and which members of Parliament asked the most questions.
By studying this data, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the Indian Parliament and the issues that matter most to its members.
